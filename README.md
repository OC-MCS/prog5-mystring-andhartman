Functions will crash if passed a default-constructed MyString
Need to consistently use library functions. Don't write your own strcpy or strcmp. This confuses everyone that looks at your code,  
thinking you must be doing something that one of the lib functions wouldn't do for you. Also, remember cout knows how to output a c-string.
